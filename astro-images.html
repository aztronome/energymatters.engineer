    	<p>Any pictures you have seen of our own milky way galaxy are likely the Andromeda galaxy as we have no pictures taken from outside our own solar system.</p>

    	<h3>M8 Lagoon Nebula</h3>

        <img src="images/Astro/M8_01jun19_avg_8of10_darks_t_bcs.jpg" alt="Lagoon Nebula">

    	<p>I was returning to phoenix from a tour of JPL visiting the Mars 2020 (now named Perserverence and Ingenuity) among other things. East of the CA/AZ state line I stopped near the Kofa Wildlife refuge. I struggled to get my gear set up and working before the sun came up so I only got about 12 minutes of usable data but from such a dark place that was enough to glimpse this beautiful nebula. </p>

    	<h3>Lunar Eclipse January 21, 2019</h3>
    	<video class="astro-video-eclipse" loop autoplay src="images/Astro/lunar_eclipse_motion_bidirect.mp4" type="video/mp4" controls></video>
    	<p>In this video of a lunar eclipse the moon appears to be moving against the background of stars behind it. A lunar eclipse always occurs during a full moon. As the earth moves into the path of light traveling from the sun to the moon we see the earths shadow cast onto the moon. The moon goes from full and bright to nearly invisible and at that moment of peak darkness the stars can be seen right next to the moon. The moon was so dark that it could hardly be seen by the naked eye during this video but my telescopes camera was sensitive enough to capture this dancing of the moon and stars. Overall it had been a pretty cloudy day. During the eclipse there were times that the clouds completely obstructed the moon, luckilly it was fairly clear clear near totallity. The sunlight passing through the earths atmosphere scatters and during the eclipse some of it strikes the dark moon giving it this red color.</p>

    	<h3>Mercury Transit November 11, 2019</h3>
    	<video class="astro-video" loop src="images/Astro/mercury_transit.mp4" type="video/mp4" controls></video>
    	<p>The tiny black dot moving toward the top left edge of the suns disk here is planet mercury. It took me a long time to process the best 153 images into this animation because the frames were significantly misaligned. I learned about scripting in photoshop to produce actions so that I could align and crop the frames together. This animation is rotated from the actual transit and I was not willing to fix it. I got out the 8 inch newtonian reflector for this task as I did not have a solar filter for the refractor. Enjoy!</p>
