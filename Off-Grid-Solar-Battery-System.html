			<h3 class="solar-h3"> 12 x SunPower BLK 250W Solar Panel = 3kW</h3>

			<p class="solar-p">These panels initially came with micro-inverters but they have been removed. The labels show specs for AC but the panels output DC. They were manufactured between 2014 and 2017. The panels are in a 3S3P configuration on the West side and a 3S1P array on the East. The solar panels original specification was 20.5% efficiency. They are mounted on Ironridge XR-100 rail system.</p>
			<p class="solar-p">Rated Power: 250W</p>
			<p class="solar-p">Open circuit voltage (VOC): 48.8V</p>
			<p class="solar-p">Max power voltage (VMP): 40.5 V</p>
			<p class="solar-p">Short circuit current (ISC): 6.56A</p>
			<p class="solar-p">Max power current:  6.17 A</p>
			<p class="solar-p">Maximum system voltage: 600V UL</p>
            <p class="solar-p">Power Tolerance: -3%/+5%</p>
            <p class="solar-p">Number of Cell: 72</p>
            <p class="solar-p">Fuse Rating: 20 A</p>
            <p class="solar-p">IP65 3 diode Junction Box with MC4 compatible connectors</p>
            <p class="solar-p">Frame: Anodized black aluminum alloy</p>
            <p class="solar-p">Weight: 33 lbs</p>
            <p class="solar-p">Dimensions: 61.4″ x 31.4″ x 1.8″</p>

            <!-- Charge Controller -->
			<h3 class="solar-h3">Charge controllers</h3>
			<p class="solar-p">The East controller is an PowMr 50A MPPT, the West unit is a 60A version of the same make.</p>

	        <h3 class="solar-h3">Battery 4kWh 48V</h3>
	        <p class="solar-p">The battery system consists of two Chevy Volt 2kWh 48V modules in parallel</p>
	        <h3 class="solar-h3">Inverters</h3>
	        <p class="solar-p">The primary Off-Grid inverter is a 4kW low frequency inverter with 85% efficiency. A 1kW grid tie inverter can run in parallel with the Off-Grid inverter. A 400W 12V inverter is ran with a step down converter from the 48V battery bus when only small loads are demanded.</p>
	        
            
            <!-- Control system -->
	        <h3 class="solar-h3">Control system</h3>
	        <p class="solar-p">The various sensors and circuits are connected to an Arduino Mega2560 with a protoboard containing several voltage dividers. The arduino is connected to a Raspberry pi acting as a data server for the output of the Arduino serail port into a python script that recieves a .csv and has two outputs it prints a constrained set of data to a terminal window for live monitoring of the system and it writes a line to a .csv file with many measurements and culculations of the system performance. Below is a graph that was generated during a 17 hour period of solar production. </p>
