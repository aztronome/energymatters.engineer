			<h3> 12 x SunPower BLK 250W Solar Panel = 3kW</h3>

			<p>These panels initially came with micro-inverters but they have been removed. The labels show specs for AC but the panels output DC. They were manufactured between 2014 and 2017. The panels are in a 3S3P configuration on the West side and a 3S1P array on the East. The solar panels original specification was 20.5% efficiency. They are mounted on Ironridge XR-100 rail system.</p>

            <!-- Charge Controller -->
			<h3>Charge controllers</h3>
			<p class="solar-p">The East controller is an PowMr 50A MPPT, the West unit is a 60A version of the same make.</p>

	        <h3 class="solar-h3">Battery 4kWh 48V</h3>
	        <p class="solar-p">The battery system consists of two Chevy Volt 2kWh 48V modules in parallel. I am developing an enclosure for them to control their temperature and to control a fire if the batteries fail.</p>
	        <h3 class="solar-h3">Inverters</h3>
	        <p class="solar-p">The primary Off-Grid inverter is a 4kW low frequency inverter with 85% efficiency. A 400W 12V inverter is ran with a step down converter from the 48V battery bus when only small loads are demanded.</p>
	        
            
            <!-- Control system -->
	        <h3 class="solar-h3">Control system</h3>
	        <p class="solar-p">The various sensors and circuits are connected to an Arduino Mega2560 with a protoboard containing several voltage dividers. The arduino is connected to a Raspberry pi acting as a data server for the output of the Arduino serial port into a python script that recieves a .csv and has two outputs it prints a constrained set of data to a terminal window for live monitoring of the system and it writes a line to a .csv file with many measurements and culculations of the system performance. <br><br>
	        Below is a graph that was generated during a 17 hour period of solar production. The two blue curves at the top of the graph represent water heater temperature sensors in the top of tank (light blue) and bottom of the tank (dark blue) and correspond to the left scale of the graph. The two green curves represent the solar power production of the East (dark green) and West (light green) panels and correspond to the scale on the right of the graph. The orange curve represents the power output of the inverter/battery and correspond to the scale on the right of the graph. The large vertical orange spikes indicate the water heater being powered by the inverter/battery. Notice the blue water heater temperature curves interacting with the orange inverter curve, the first three spikes show that the top heating element was energized and during the third spike the water heater switched to the bottom heating element for subsequent spikes. The two horizontal curves in the middle of the graph purple and light orange represent the temperature in the garage where the battery and inverter are and the exterior temperature respectively these correspond to the left scale. Finally the blue horizontal line near the middle of the graph represents the battery voltage(~48V) and we can see it drop when the orange inverter spikes occur. A lot of information can be extracted from these graphs and tell more than you ever wanted to know about the behavior of a water heater.</p>
