	        			<p>I started building an off-grid solar battery system to protect my family from a power outage. In the Arizona heat it is essential to have a refrigerator and air conditioner.

	        			<p>A few years ago I dove down the rabbit hole that is astrophotography. Spending many nights in dark cold places on mouintain tops throughout the southwest I would speak sweetly to and sometimes curse my equipment and my freezing hands.</p>

	        			<p>I am designing a semi-portable remote operated telescope observatory designed to be small, light and cheap while still yielding great results. Currently a 102mm carbon fiber triplet refractor operates on a celestron AVX mount that has been hypertuned. The observatory will have to protect the equipment from snow loads and wind.</p>

	        			<p>I am an electical engineering student at Arizona State University in my junior year. I am a veteran of the U.S. Navy Seabees. I developed an interst in the ability to live off grid addressing both preparedness and the move to sustainable energy. This includes growing food, producing energy at home with solar panels and trying to throw away less and recycle more.</p>
