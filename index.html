	        			<p>Initially I started building an off-grid solar battery system to protect the food in our refrigerator. If the power went out for 24-48 hours and the air conditioner was off in adition to refrigerator the food will start to go bad especially if the door is opened several times to get the food.

	        			<p>A few years ago I dove down the rabbit hole that is astrophotography. Spending many nights in dark cold places throughout the southwest I would speak sweetly to and sometimes curse my equipment and my freezing hands.</p>

	        			<p>I am designing a semi-portable remote operated telescope observatory that will eventually be placed near Heber Arizona. The system is designed to be small, light and cheap while still yielding great results. It will be controlled from the phoenix area for testing and eventually from anywhere in the world. Currently a 102mm carbon fiber triplet refractor operates on a celestron AVX mount that has been hypertuned. The observatory will have to protect the equipment from snow loads and wind.</p>

	        			<p>I am an electical engineering student at Arizona State University in my junior year. I am a veteran of the U.S. Navy Seabees. I developed an interst in the ability to live off grid addressing both preparedness and the move to sustainable energy. This includes growing food, producing energy at home with solar panels and trying to throw away less and recycle more.</p>
